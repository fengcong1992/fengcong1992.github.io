**Satellite Image Processing for Fundamental Resource Discovery based on Co-occurence Semantic Segmentation**

In this research, we propose a co-occurrence semantic segmentation theory based on cognitive scene understanding, therefore, solving challenging computer vision issues, including label imbalance and boundary ambiguity. The co-occurrence semantic segmentation theory is based on the conjecture that some relevant elements in images tend to occur and be located in a predictable manner, which is a conditional/marginal probability problem. The proposed co-occurrence semantic segmentation will be verified by BTM-PV array detection through satellite aerial image processing.
