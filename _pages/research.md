**Satellite Image Processing for Fundamental Resource Discovery based on Co-occurence Semantic Segmentation**
Semantic segmentation provides per-pixel labels of object categories for the given image, which is a challenging task requiring accurate prediction of the object category, location, and shape. Segmenting small objects is even more difficult, due to the label imbalance, annotation with low quality, and boundary ambiguity. The existing semantic segmentation methods are mostly based on convolutional neural networks, which capture image features by spatial-invariant receptive fields. Such feature representation cannot capture the coherent physical correlations in the real-world images and results in limited scene understanding capability. In this research, we proposed an image semantic segmentation based on the image objective co-occurrence probability theory, which is called the co-occurrence semantic segmentation. The co-occurrence semantic segmentation relies on the conjecture that some relevant elements in images tend to occur with high joint probability and be located in a predictable manner. The co-occurrence semantic segmentation is realized by integrating prior feature maps that contain features of co-occurring image objectives into the network for target objective segmentation. This co-occurrence feature map prior merging methodology is flexible with different deep learning architectures, and will be first tested with the UNet backbone based on our preliminary research. The proposed theoretical method will be validated and verified by solving a satellite image processing based ‘behind-the-meter’ photovoltaic array (BTM-PV) detection. The BTM-PV semantic segmentation will rely on the dependence and image spatial correlations between BTM-PV and building rooves. Case studies will be performed based on open-source datasets. The success of the co-occurrence semantic segmentation methodology, with both theoretical and practical meanings, will advance not only the cutting-edge deep learning techniques, but also their applications to the mission-critical energy data research.
