**Satellite Image Processing for Fundamental Resource Discovery based on Co-occurence Semantic Segmentation**

In this research, we propose a co-occurrence semantic segmentation theory based on cognitive scene understanding, therefore, solving challenging computer vision issues, including label imbalance and boundary ambiguity. The co-occurrence semantic segmentation theory is based on the conjecture that some relevant elements in images tend to occur and be located in a predictable manner, which is a conditional/marginal probability problem. The proposed co-occurrence semantic segmentation will be verified by BTM-PV array detection through satellite aerial image processing.

**Performance-based Energy Resource Feedback, Optimization, and Risk Management (PERFORM) Data Generation**

<img src="/images/PERFORM.png" style="zoom:50%;  float:left; padding:0.7em"/>
This project aims at generating open-source datasets consisting of one year of time-coincident load, wind, and solar actuals and probabilistic forecasts for regions similar to ERCOT, NYISO, SPP, and MISO. These datasets serve as an uncertainty quantification basis for the ARPA-E Performance-Based Energy Resource Feedback, Optimization, and Risk Management (PERFORM) program. The project utilizes several resource assessment, resource modeling, and machine/deep learning techniques/datasets, including the the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB), the Weather Research and Forecasting Model, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the Renewable Energy Potential (reV) Model, the Bayesian Model Averaging, and the Machine Learning-based Multi-Model (M3).

**Solar Uncertainty Management and Mitigation for Exceptional Reliability in Grid Operations (2018-2021, funded by DOE EERE)**
<div class="warning">
<p style='padding:0.7em; margin-left:0.7em; display: inline-block;'>
<img src="/images/Framework_Summergo.png" style="zoom:25%;  float:left; padding:0.7em"/>
This project will bring probabilistic solar forecasts into ERCOTâ€™s real-time operation environment through automated reserve and dispatch tools that increase economic efficiency and improve system reliability. The adaptive reserves aim to reduce overall reserve levels by 25% while maintaining or improving system reliability. The risk- parity dispatch will automate the use of probabilistic forecast information in a 5-minute dispatch window. The situational awareness tool will present forecast uncertainty information that is relevant, timely, and allows for better decision making.

**WindView: An Open Platform for Wind Energy Forecast Visualization (2016-2019, funded by DOE EERE)**

<p style='padding:0.1em; margin-left:0.7em; display: inline-block;'>
<img src="/images/WindView.png" style="zoom:20%;  float:left; padding:0.7em"/>
This project developed an open-source situational awareness and decision support platform called WindView that provides grid operators with knowledge on the state and performance of wind power on their system. In this project, we developed a wind power forecaster, Machine Learning-based Multi-Model (M3), which provides both deterministic and probabilistic wind power forecasts and has been integrated into WindView.

**Hierarchy-based Disaggregate Forecasting Using Deep Machine Learning in Power System Time Series (2017-2018, funded by International Institute of Forecasters)**
<div class="warning">
<p style='padding:0.1em; margin-left:0.7em; display: inline-block;'>
<img src="/images/Disagg.png" style="zoom:70%;  float:left; padding:0.7em"/>
This project addressed the challenges of collecting decentralized information in power systems, by developing an innovative dynamic big data driven nonintrusive disaggregate forecasting methodology based on deep machine learning. Detailed information is provided by the developed framework at the different levels to help the electricity users, utilities, and policy makers for better power system management.

**Data-Driven Hierarchical Load Forecasting with Distributed Energy Resources (2017-2019, funded by Oncor)**

<p style='padding:0.1em; margin-left:0.7em; display: inline-block;'>
<img src="/images/Oncor_Dashboard.png" style="zoom:65%;  float:left; padding:0.7em"/>
The large amount of historical weather, outages, smart meter data collected by Oncor provides an opportunity for new analysis and forecasting of power outage and load. This project developed an data-driven analytical framework to produce data manipulation processes and algorithms enabling premise-based load forecasting for Oncor, which has been integrated in Oncor's Cloud Computing Server and Enterprise Data Warehouse.
