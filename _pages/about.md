About Me
------
I am a [Director's Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.nrel.gov/research/staff/cong-feng.html) in the [Sensing and Predictive Analytics Group](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/sensing-predictive-analytics.html) (SePA) at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov) (NREL). I earned my Ph.D. and M.S. in [Mechanical Engineering](https://me.utdallas.edu) from [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu) (UTD) and my B.S. in [Power Engineering](https://en.whu.edu.cn/pmc/Departments___Groups/Department__of_Power_Engineering.htm) from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn) (WHU).

My research objective is to enhance the reliability, resilience, and security of power and enegy systems by promoting decision intelligence through artificial intelligence (AI) and big data. My research interests are in the areas of power systems, renewable energy, AI, and data science. I have led 1 project as a PI, 3 projects as a Co-PI (2.3 M funding in total), 4 projects as a Technical Team Leader or Task Leader with national and international collaborations. The significance of my research contributions has been demonstrated in 2 book chapters, 18 accepted journal publications (another 2 papers under review and 3 papers to be submitted), 16 top-notched conference papers, and 3 peer-reviewed technical reports, which have been cited by over 1,000 times. My research has been recognized by several awards at various levels, including 1 research award, 2 best (student) paper awards at the 2017 PES General Meeting and a Big Data Conference, and 2 fellowships. The fundamental methodologies I developed have been widely deployed in real-world systems at regional- and national-levels. 

I am actively participating in synergistic activities. I am serving as editors for journals of Advances in Applied Energy, Data in Brief, and Forecasting. I am a reviewer for more than 20 journals with 200+ times, and received the Outstanding Reviewer of IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy for consecutive two years. I am co-organizing the "Design and Optimization of Sustainable Energy Systems Session" in the [ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences](https://event.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/Program). I am also involved in the organizing committee of the [IEEE PES Grid Edge Technologies Conference & Exposition](https://pes-gridedge.org).
