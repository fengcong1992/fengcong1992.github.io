About Me
------
I am a [Director's Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.nrel.gov/research/staff/cong-feng.html) in the [Sensing and Predictive Analytics Group](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/sensing-predictive-analytics.html) (SePA) at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov) (NREL). I earned my Ph.D. and M.S. in [Mechanical Engineering](https://me.utdallas.edu) from [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu) (UTD) and my B.S. in [Power Engineering](https://en.whu.edu.cn/pmc/Departments___Groups/Department__of_Power_Engineering.htm) from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn).

My research focuses on renewable energy, smart grid, power system artificial intelligence, and energy informatics. I have (co-)authored more than 30 peer-reviewed publications. I am serving as editors for journals of Data in Brief and Forecasting. I am also co-organizing the "Design and Optimization of Sustainable Energy Systems Session" in the [ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences](https://event.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/Program).
