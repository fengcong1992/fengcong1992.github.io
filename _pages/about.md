About Me
------
I am a [Director's Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.nrel.gov/research/staff/cong-feng.html) in the [Sensing and Predictive Analytics Group](https://www.nrel.gov/grid/sensing-predictive-analytics.html) (SePA) at the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory](https://www.nrel.gov) (NREL). I earned my Ph.D. and M.S. in [Mechanical Engineering](https://me.utdallas.edu) from [The University of Texas at Dallas](https://www.utdallas.edu) (UTD) and my B.S. in [Power Engineering](https://en.whu.edu.cn/pmc/Departments___Groups/Department__of_Power_Engineering.htm) from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn) (WHU).

My research focuses on renewable energy, smart grid, power system artificial intelligence, and energy informatics. I have (co-)authored more than 40 peer-reviewed publications. My research received multiple rewards and grants at different levels. In addition, I am serving as editors for journals of Advances in Applied Energy, Data in Brief, and Forecasting. I am a reviewer for more than 20 journals and received the Outstanding Reviewer of IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy for consecutive two years. I am also co-organizing the "Design and Optimization of Sustainable Energy Systems Session" in the [ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences](https://event.asme.org/IDETC-CIE/Program). I am also involved in the organizing committee of the [IEEE PES Grid Edge Technologies Conference & Exposition](https://pes-gridedge.org).
