I believe that promoting the development of students’ critical thinking is one of the most important goals of any educator. Critical thinking is especially necessary for engineering students who need to transfer abstract theories and applicational problem-solving skills to novel situations. The key skills of critical thinking that I hope to help students develop include problem interpretation, analysis, evaluation, inference, explanation, and self-regulation. I find that it is effective to practice these critical thinking skills by linking the structured theoretical knowledge to the engineering applications in an active and cooperative learning environment. It is efficient to achieve this goal by developing course projects based on the course concepts and real-world problems.

**MECH 1100 Introduction to Mechanical Engineering I**

The purpose of this course is to give students a general understanding of the broad range of technical areas and applications specific to the mechanical engineering profession. Course activities include team oriented‐ competitions and lectures by mechanical engineering experts. The learning objectives/outcomes for this course are as follows:

-Introduction of mechanical engineering topics (mechanical design, forces in structures and machines, materials and stresses, motion and power transmission, fluids engineering, thermal and energy systems).
-Problem-solving and communication skills. 
-Teamwork and group projects.

In this research, we propose a co-occurrence semantic segmentation theory based on cognitive scene understanding, therefore, solving challenging computer vision issues, including label imbalance and boundary ambiguity. The co-occurrence semantic segmentation theory is based on the conjecture that some relevant elements in images tend to occur and be located in a predictable manner, which is a conditional/marginal probability problem. The proposed co-occurrence semantic segmentation will be verified by BTM-PV array detection through satellite aerial image processing.

This project aims at generating open-source datasets consisting of one year of time-coincident load, wind, and solar actuals and probabilistic forecasts for regions similar to ERCOT, NYISO, SPP, and MISO. These datasets serve as an uncertainty quantification basis for the ARPA-E Performance-Based Energy Resource Feedback, Optimization, and Risk Management (PERFORM) program. The project utilizes several resource assessment, resource modeling, and machine/deep learning techniques/datasets, including the the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB), the Weather Research and Forecasting Model, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), the Renewable Energy Potential (reV) Model, the Bayesian Model Averaging, and the Machine Learning-based Multi-Model (M3).

This project will bring probabilistic solar forecasts into ERCOT’s real-time operation environment through automated reserve and dispatch tools that increase economic efficiency and improve system reliability. The adaptive reserves aim to reduce overall reserve levels by 25% while maintaining or improving system reliability. The risk- parity dispatch will automate the use of probabilistic forecast information in a 5-minute dispatch window. The situational awareness tool will present forecast uncertainty information that is relevant, timely, and allows for better decision making.
